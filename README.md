# Javascript_Quiz

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a web aplication from scratch implementing html layout, css styles and javascript for user interation
- This webpage is a Javascript quiz that has a 60 second timer and multiple choices with four questions
- From this project, I learned how to add a timer on Javascript, and how to use query selectors and getElementbyID to link my html and css sheet and manipulate them through javascript
- In addition, I used buttons to switch between screens with html and make them interactive
